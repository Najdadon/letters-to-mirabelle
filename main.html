I was just thinking about you,how your laugh gets stuck in my head in the best way. You really got this way of making everything feel lighter. Can’t lie, I like it a lot.</p>

Not gonna lie, you sneak into my thoughts more than I expected. Sometimes I catch myself smiling like an idiot just thinking of you. Don’t know if you meant to do that, but it’s working.</p>

          <h3>Letter — Dreams</h3>
          <p>Amir,
Sometimes I catch myself imagining the future,not the big, crazy "life plans” kind of future,but the little things. Laughing with you over dumb stuff, sharing random thoughts at 2 AM, just being there for each other no matter what.
You’ve made an impact on me that I didn’t expect. You’re not just someone I like, you’re someone I admire. I admire your heart, your mind, the way you see the world. And even though we’re taking things slow, I feel like I’m already learning so much just from being around you.
I guess what I’m saying is, I care about you, Mirabelle, a lot and I want to keep showing you that, every second, every minute, every hour, every day, every week, every month, every year, in ways big and small.

          <h3>Letter — Wonder</h3>
          <p>Hey Babe,
Sometimes I wonder how one person can make such a big impact on someone’s life. Then I think of you, and it all makes sense. You’ve got this way of being gentle, fun, and real all at the same time, and I can’t help but feel drawn to that.
I want to be someone who makes you feel the way you make me feel happy, safe, appreciated, and wanted. Because you really are all of that and more to me.

          <h3>Letter — Yearning</h3>
          <p>Mirabelle,
I can’t stop thinking about you. It’s like no matter what I’m doing, my mind keeps drifting back to you. I miss the sound of your voice, the way your laugh hits just right, the way everything feels lighter when you’re around.
I keep wishing I could be there with you right now just sitting beside you, talking, laughing, maybe doing absolutely nothing but feeling like it’s the best moment in the world. It’s strange how one person can make the world feel so empty when they’re not there and so full when they are.
I guess what I’m really trying to say is I miss you, more than I can put into words. And I’m looking forward to the next time I get to see you, hold a conversation with you, or just be near you. Because with you, everything feels right, even the quiet moments.

         <h3>Light in My Day</h3>
        <p>Your smile sneaks into my day,<br> A quiet light I can’t push away.<br> Every thought drifts back to you,<br> And I’m lost in what I feel is true.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="poem">
         <h3>Quiet Presence</h3>
        <p>Your smile sneaks into my day,<br> A calm within life’s frantic pace.<br> Your presence lingers in quiet ways,<br> Turning ordinary into brighter days.</p>
      </div>
       <div class="poem">
         <h3>If Hearts Could Text</h3>
        <p>If hearts could text, mine would ping,<br> Every moment, your laugh would ring.<br> You make the normal feel brand new,<br>And yeah, I kinda like you too.</p>
      </div>
       <div class="poem">
         <h3>Until Then</h3>
        <p>I miss the sound of your voice,<br> The way your laughter bends the day.<br> I miss the quiet moments we share,<br> When words aren’t needed to say,<br> How much you mean, how much I care.<br> <br> I wonder what you’re doing now,<br> If life’s little chaos finds you well.<br>
          I wish I could be there beside you,<br> To hear your stories, hear your spell<br> Of lighting up a room with just yourself.<br> <br>Until then, I’ll keep you in my thoughts,<br>Tracing your name across my mind.<br>The distance is small in memory,<br>But I ache for the moments we’ll find,<br>When your hand is mine, and time’s unlined.</p>
      </div>
       <div class="poem">
         <h3>Your Name</h3>
        <p>There’s a quiet in the world I only feel with you,<br> A weight lifted, a storm subdued.<br> Your presence is a gentle flame,<br> A warmth I never knew I craved.<br> <br> I watch you and see more than light,<br> I see a soul that’s brave and bright.<br>
          Even in silence, you speak to me,<br> In ways that words can barely reach.<br> <br>I don’t know the paths that lie ahead,<br>But I know I want them with you instead.<br>Every thought, every hope, every dream<br>Feels fuller when you’re in the frame,<br>A simple truth, unspoken, yet supreme,<br>My world is better with your name.</p>
