        <h3>Letter — Just Thinking of You</h3>
        <p>Hey Mirabelle,
I was just thinking about you,how your laugh gets stuck in my head in the best way. You really got this way of making everything feel lighter. Can’t lie, I like it a lot.</p>

        <h3>Letter — Smiling Idiot</h3>
        <p>Yo Beautiful,
Not gonna lie, you sneak into my thoughts more than I expected. Sometimes I catch myself smiling like an idiot just thinking of you. Don’t know if you meant to do that, but it’s working.</p>
      </article>
      <article class="letter">
        <h3>Letter — Dreams</h3>
        <p>Amir,
Sometimes I catch myself imagining the future,not the big, crazy "life plans” kind of future,but the little things. Laughing with you over dumb stuff, sharing random thoughts at 2 AM, just being there for each other no matter what.
You’ve made an impact on me that I didn’t expect. You’re not just someone I like, you’re someone I admire. I admire your heart, your mind, the way you see the world. And even though we’re taking things slow, I feel like I’m already learning so much just from being around you.
I guess what I’m saying is, I care about you, Mirabelle, a lot and I want to keep showing you that, every second, every minute, every hour, every day, every week, every month, every year, in ways big and small.

        <article class="letter">
        <h3>Letter — Wonder</h3>
        <p>Hey Babe,
Sometimes I wonder how one person can make such a big impact on someone’s life. Then I think of you, and it all makes sense. You’ve got this way of being gentle, fun, and real all at the same time, and I can’t help but feel drawn to that.
I want to be someone who makes you feel the way you make me feel happy, safe, appreciated, and wanted. Because you really are all of that and more to me.

       <article class="letter">
        <h3>Letter — Yearning</h3>
        <p>Mirabelle,
I can’t stop thinking about you. It’s like no matter what I’m doing, my mind keeps drifting back to you. I miss the sound of your voice, the way your laugh hits just right, the way everything feels lighter when you’re around.
I keep wishing I could be there with you right now just sitting beside you, talking, laughing, maybe doing absolutely nothing but feeling like it’s the best moment in the world. It’s strange how one person can make the world feel so empty when they’re not there and so full when they are.
I guess what I’m really trying to say is I miss you, more than I can put into words. And I’m looking forward to the next time I get to see you, hold a conversation with you, or just be near you. Because with you, everything feels right, even the quiet moments.
